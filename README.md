<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project aims to train an artificial intelligence that is able to classify/label a person with an occupation according to his/her given biography. Users can find Wikipedia random page very useful: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Random", which I mainly use to test this program. Please note that the more famous the selected people/corpus are, the higher the acuracy this artificial intelligence can achieve. 
<br>
It includes 3 java files: 
<ol>
    <li> textClassifier.java
    <li> people.java
    <li> helper.java
</ol>
The division of work is: <br/>
- Main.java: includes the top-level functions (e.g. main()), in which it will read the corpus, train the AI, and run the classifier. 
<br>
- people.java: representing the data structure of each biography with three fields: name, category and the words in the biography. 
<br>
- helper.java: includes some of the helper methods that Main.java will use, e.g. the stop words identifier.

## Getting Started

Please run this program under the Main.java. The user can change the EPSILON that is defined at the very top of the file for calculating the Laplacian correction (line 6). This program does not offer any input checking, so invalid commands will most probably be encountered with NullPointerException. That is to say, please run the program as it is intended to be runned or tested. 
<br>
A valid input should be consisted of biographies of people separated by line breaks, and each biography should be formated as: 
<br>
First Line: Name
<br>
Second Line: Occupation/Category
<br>
Third Line: First paragraph of the 
<br/><br/>
Note that I also include a sample input that is randomly generated by the Wikipedia using its random page function (Alt-Shift+X for Windows, and Control-option+X for mac) in the project for testing convenience, and thus should be able to be runned directly using the instructions followed. 
<br/><br/>
Also note that I only <b>round the number until when printing the result. 

## Running

1. Default parameters: 
   ```sh
    public static final double EPSILON = 0.1;
   ```
2. Sample command line arguments: 
    ```sh
    javac textClassifier.java
    java textClassifier sample.txt 15
    ```
3. Sample results for the default parameters: 
   ```sh
